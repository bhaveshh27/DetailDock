.NET 8 Web Application
Overview
This project is a .NET 8 web application developed based on a task. The application implements a series of tasks to create a robust backend service that interacts with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL storage. This README outlines the steps taken to complete the project.

Tasks Implemented
1. .NET 8 Web Application
A .NET 8 web application was initialized using the .NET CLI. The application serves as the foundation for implementing the required functionalities.

2.  DTOs & Models 
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Models were created to match the task specifications. These DTOs and Models are used to structure the data handled by the application.

3. Implemented CRUD APIs
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs were developed to manage data within the application. These APIs enable users to interact with the application to perform operations on the data.

4. Data Storage in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL
Data is stored in Azure Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database service. For local development and testing, the Cosmos DB Emulator was used to simulate the Azure Cosmos DB environment.

5. Utilized Dependency Injection
Dependency injection was utilized to manage the dependencies within the application. This helps in creating a more modular, testable, and maintainable codebase.
